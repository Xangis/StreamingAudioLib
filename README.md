# StreamingAudioLib

This is a library for buffer-based audio playback.

It is used by some of the applications at https://github.com/Xangis
for sound playback.

It is released under the terms of the MIT license.

# Building

On Windows, use the Visual Studio project to build the library.

On Linux, most projects just compile in the source files that they need.

# Development Status

I actively maintain this library because many of my applications depend on it.
